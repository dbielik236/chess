## Reflection:
I learned so much from this project. First, this project helped me get a firm grasp on understanding classes and object oriented programming. Second, this was a large project that took a lot of time, a lot of thought, plenty of problem-solving, and organization. Last, if I had to do it all over again, I would have approached the program very differently. The checkmate function ultimately does not work properly because I made it way to complicated and repeated a lot of code. Simplifying the choices of moves from the beginning would have made thing much simpler and smoother. All in all a really great project that tested my abilities and made me think differently about my programming.
